# CDDA-Skill-Antirust
This mod does one thing, and one thing only: adds a 0 point-cost mutation called "Rustproof Skills" to the game, available at character creation or via the debug menu, that essentially "disables" skill rust.  The idea itself was random-cdda-modder's; I just packaged it into a standalone mod to make it a little easier for the average player to use.
